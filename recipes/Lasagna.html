<p>“Amazing recipe,” raves one Allrecipes community member. “Loved the simplicity. [I] was able to use gluten-free Barilla noodles and lactose-free cottage cheese to suit our dietary needs. Superb!”

“I have made this recipe many, many times and it always turns out PERFECT,” according to Mike Weiner. “It’s easy, it’s fun to prepare, and whatever is leftover saves well, so I get multiple meals from it! I share this recipe all the time and it will always be my go-to lasagna!”
